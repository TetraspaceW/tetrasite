      <p>
        Welcome to my shills list! A shills list is a list of works that I
        greatly enjoy, enough so that I'll point to them here and say "this,
        this is good". The advantage of a shills list is that people often have
        similar clusters of tastes, and sometimes you'll have enjoyed a few
        works in that cluster and want to see more; or perhaps you just want an
        insight into Tetraspace's soul, see what works of fiction really
        resonate with her. Maybe you're an aspiring fiction-matchmaker, and you
        want to see what I already like to make some good additional matches (ðŸ¥º
        Send them if so? ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ)!
      </p>

        The concept of a shills list is something that I came across with{" "}
        <a href="https://recordcrash.com/">Makin's shills list</a>, which sure
        contains a lot of things that I like, and almost forms a canon of
        something that's not exactly but related to rationalfic
        (rational-adjacent-fic? ðŸ˜œ). I make no promises of being as canonical,
        but I hope you enjoy!
