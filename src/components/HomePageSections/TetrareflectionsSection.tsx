        I do some thinking about things and matters, and some of these thinkings
        deserve the title of Tetrareflections (which is not lofty, but it is a
        topic-cluster that perhaps exists enough to have a name), and some of
        them are on <Link to="/tetrareflections">this page</Link>.
