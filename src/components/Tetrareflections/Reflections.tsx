          can't wait until the singularity and after a few thousand years I‚Äôve
          replaced embarrassment with better posthuman embarrassment and then I
          can post the rest of my fanfictions

          It has something of the nature of how I will predictably be a better
          chess player as well, but am not thereby better at chess for knowing
          that.

          poly discourse misses the mark for tetrabrains because MY experience
          is that I spawned in poly the moment it was pointed out to me that
          it's a thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          once I was in a mono relationship for two weeks and my thoughts on
          that matter was ‚ÄúI wish I could bring up poly, but I don't know if
          that's an allowed move in this game, and affection is rare enough that
          I don't want to rock the boat and lose it‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>lol hopefully I'm better at communicating nowadays</p>
        <p>
          anyway yeah that subtle note of discontent? that social pressure that
          the bay areans feel to seek enlightened? that jealousy being squashed?
          don't have em
        </p>
        <p>
          highly recommend listening to subtle notes of discontent tho.
          relationships are about u and u being happy and there are all kinds of
          people with all kids of wants who would be happiest with different
          things üíñ

          I can't hold Keeper secrecy oaths (where you act as you would if you
          didn't know the information), and if I could others wouldn‚Äôt know to
          trust it, and besides they have preferences about my state of
          knowledge, but there is so much gossip I want to know everything
          about.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's SUCH a gulf between minds, everyone is lying and distorting
          all the time or just straight not telling me because genuinely why
          would they, and while I have other things going on Tetra::Curiosity
          doesn't care about the usefulness it just wants to KNOW.

          I think the biggest cost, if I stayed psychologically similar but
          somehow magically became the ghost of gossip gnosis, would be the
          Burden of Knowledge; I would know about people being hurt, who don't
          want to be hurt, and be forbidden to help them, or even unrelated
          others.
